# DigitalFundamental

This repos is used for code training.

I have already found a lot of great materials:

1. [Algorithm and data structure](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club)
2. [RayMarching](https://github.com/miloyip/light2d)
3. [RayTracing](https://raytracing.github.io)
4. [Soft render by using rasterization](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer)

By using these great material, it will be more easy to obtain the core idea of computer graphics. and by the way, this repos will be used by my own to include more training codes.
